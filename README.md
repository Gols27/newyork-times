### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a movie streaming dashboard using JavaScript and Angular.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Thikkiiana City,** on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. Wookies are the main exporter of Computer Technology for the New Republic so naturally you roll up your sleeves and get to work. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

- Implement assignment using:
  - Language: **JavaScript**
  - Framework: **Angular**
- Build out the project to the designs inside the `/Designs` folder
- Connect your application to the **CodeSubmit Movie Database** at `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies`
- For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer Wookie2021"` header
- Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Make sure to group movies by categories**.
- Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
- Make sure that inking to detail pages as well as bookmarking works as expected
-     Add like button for each movie and like count
-     View details page
-     Quick view on hover (flip or any other animation)
-     Implement Sorting, grouping, and searching by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`
-     Add basic custom styling to details page, and the movies card (movies above rating 7 have any indicators/style)
-     Lazy loading (3 movies per row)
-     Add a layout for the app with header and navigation (home, about, etc)

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **JavaScript** best practices
- We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
